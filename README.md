# 👋 Hi there, I'm Shruti Shukla

🎓 I'm a final-year Computer Science student (B.Tech CSE), passionate about **Python**, **Data Science**, and **AI/ML**.  
Starting with Java, I gradually shifted towards solving real-world problems through **data-driven solutions** and **machine learning**.

---

## 🌱 What I'm Learning
- Python for Data Analysis & Machine Learning
- Data Structures & Algorithms
- Deep Learning (RNN, LSTM, Transformers – beginner level)
- Project-based learning through hands-on development

---

## 💻 Projects I’m Working On

### 🎶 AI Music Generation App  
An intelligent system that generates music from text using **deep learning** and **language models**.  
→ Built using Python, LLM APIs, and basic audio processing techniques.

### 🧠 AI Text Summarizer  
A tool that takes long text input and generates concise summaries using **natural language processing** (NLP) and **LLMs**.  
→ Built with Python, OpenAI/LM Studio APIs, and streamlit/Flask (if applicable).  
→ Ideal for note-taking, quick research, or reducing reading time.

### 👤 Face Recognition System  
A Python-OpenCV-based app for real-time face recognition using LBPH and Haarcascades.

### 🧠 Personal Learning Repositories  
- [Python & DSA Notes](https://github.com/911-shruti/Python) – my hands-on journey through Python programming and data structures
- Small scripts, automation tools, and CLI mini-apps (in progress)

---

## 🤝 Open to Collaborate On
- Beginner-friendly open-source projects
- ML, automation, or data analysis projects
- Real-world ideas where I can learn and contribute
